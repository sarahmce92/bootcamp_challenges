        Recent graduate of Le Wagon, London, I am particularly interested in frontend developement.
        I am skilled in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also enjoy SCSS and Bootstrap.
        At present I am learning React.js.
        <br>
        <br>
        I previously worked as a specialist paediatric speech and language therapist for NHS Scotland. I specialised in profound and multiple learning disabilities, and complex needs.
        <br>
        <br>
        From 2015-2018 I studied MSc Speech and language therapy at Queen Margaret University in Edinbugh.
        Prior to this, I lived and worked in Nova Scotia, Canada for three years, after earning my bachelors degree in Early Years and Childhood Studies from University College Cork, Ireland.
        <br>
        <br>
        I love animals of all kinds. I have a gorgeous rescue greyhound named Holly.
